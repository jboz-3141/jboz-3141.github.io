    <td>I learnt by trying lots of different options, working my way around the problem when I was stuck. For example, when I had the problem of already having a page, I tried two methods, and found that one more better (in that it worked for me) and that was simpler and quicker.</td>

    <td>I think my initiative was lacking today. I should have filled in this blog as soon as I had done the test, and should have read and contemplated the slides put on Google Classroom. If I had made better use of my time, by using my initiative to do things rather than waiting for Mr Keen to tell me to.</td>

    <td>Next time, I will not hesitate to fill in my blog when I have finished something or as I go along, to make the best use of my time. Also I should have read and used all the resources that Mr Keen put on the classroom to help me when I could rather than waiting to be told to do so.</td>
